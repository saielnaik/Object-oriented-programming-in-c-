## Similarities between C and C++ are: 
 

Both the languages have a similar syntax.

Code structure of both the languages are same.

The compilation of both the languages is similar.

They share the same basic syntax. Nearly all of C’s operators and keywords are also present in C++ and do the same thing.

C++ has a slightly extended grammar than C, but the basic grammar is the same.

Basic memory model of both is very close to the hardware.

Same notions of stack, heap, file-scope and static variables are present in both the languages.
